🙌🏼 Team Effort: A huge shoutout to our talented team members who poured their creativity, expertise, and dedication into bringing this project to life. The brilliant minds behind this innovation are: Deblina Mandal, Subhradeep Pal, Kashmira Jha, Pratyush Banerjee and MD Safiul Haque. Together, we've created a game that's all about fun, strategy, and connection.

🌐 Features and Tech Stack used for this project are: • User-Friendly Interface: Designed with JavaScript and React JS, coupled with Material UI, our frontend ensures a seamless and visually appealing gaming experience.

• Powerful Backend: Python and Django form the backbone of our game, ensuring stability, security, and smooth gameplay.

• Data Management: SQLite database guarantees efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.

• Real-Time Interaction: Thanks to Django Channels and Redis, our WebSocket functionality enables lightning-fast communication, so you never miss a move or a message.

• Production Deployment: Used VPS server for deploying both frontend and backend applications, used docker container for containerization of our applications, Uvicorn (Async Server Gateway Interface) was used to serve actual requests( both HTTP and WS requests) and Nginx was used to setup reverse proxies with the domain s and subdomains.

The motive of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time spent with your friends together.🤟🏼 So, invite your friends, start a game and may the best strategist win! Good luck 👍🏼and have a blast! 🥳

📝Note That : Both clients should have good internet connections for better game play experience. The development process is still in progress.

😊We are open to any suggestions and feedbacks.

~~Thank you
